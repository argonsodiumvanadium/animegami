#### The Omniscient Goddess That Watches Over The Animeverse
<br>
### About<br>
This website is basially a complete and independent ecosystem for anime lovers,<br>
one can stream anime, read manga and listen to music in this website free of cost<br><br>
though i have not exactly added an inbuilt streaming video component, nor an inbuilt manga reader, due<br>
to problems in webscraping, which when done continuously would have added an overhead<br> weight on the UX and
the WIFI,<br> So this website creates links which hit the target websites at an accuracy of 85%<br>
the odds are not that great, but is the best I could squeeze out of the website<br><Br>
some animes or mangas might not be displayed, due to them not being available or in general due to <br>
inconsistency in nomenclature<br><Br>
### Testing :
<br>
this project relies heavily on AJAX, so you will need to start up a server, static files will not work,<br>
the directory structure should be left like this,<bR>When transpiling with `babel` dont forget to remove the `"use strict"` header<br>
that header usually crashes the program
